#Learning Git
This Repo is to learn and practice using **git** and **github** 

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system, we utilize it to maintain the history of our projects as well as the diffrent versions of it. 

## What is a commit? 
Acts as a checkpoint for our project its a snapshot of our project during that point in time. We canuse **commits** to roll back changes to that point in time. **Commits** are how we are keeping track of our project's history

## What is a push?
Pushing allows us to move our commit to a remote repository. In this case github

## What are branches?
Branches are diffrent versions of our repo created from a commit. They allow us to work on diffrent versions of our project simultaneously with others while keeping our work independent. Master/Main branch is usually the default branch with the most changes.

## What is merging?
Merging is taking it to another. Usually we'll have feature branches that branched of the Main branch and we'll merge once the feature is complete.
